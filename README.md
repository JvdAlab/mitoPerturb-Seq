Notes from Stephen:

For the bulk RNAseq analysis, the Methods section contains the software packages used, but we can always expand on this with a markdown document that contains the various options used for each step as you suggest. 
For the EdgeR analysis I just followed the user guide https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/edgeR/inst/doc/edgeRUsersGuide.pdf, so it probably makes sense to just reference that rather than including specific code.
